      <h1>Read free e-books on your mobile?</h1>
      <p>It seems you've come to the right place!</p>

      <p>
        Here you'll find <i>free</i> e-books, that have been <i>specially optimized for your
        phone</i>. All books are <i>split to chapters</i>, and <i>compiled as EPUB files</i>, so that they'll
        <i>load fast</i> and <i>run smoothly</i> on your device. Many children's books, <i>have images</i>, too, and
        they have been re-sized so that they'd take very little space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Search for and download books from you phone's browser? Just put an 'm'
        as the first sub-domain, like so: <a href="http://m.albite.vlexofree.com/">http://m.albite.vlexofree.com/</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next step is <i>reading the books</i> or, in other words, getting a book reader for your phone. If you have a
        <i>Java-Mobile powered</i> device you may have a look at <%= link_to 'Albite READER', reader_url %>, see the
        video a few pixels down this text? If you like it, well, go ahead and <%= link_to 'download', reader_url %> it!
        It's free. Oh, and by the way, it does support dictionary look-up, yes. But then, why don't make a
        dictionary yourself? You see, <%= link_to 'Albite READER', reader_url %> is also open-source.
      </p>

      <p>
        Got you interested? Wonder who and why made all this? Visit the <%= link_to 'About', about_url %> section then.
