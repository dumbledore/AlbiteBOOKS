  Your phone can install apps only over the internet? No worries, just visit
  <a href="http://m.albite.vlexofree.com/reader">the mobile site</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Want to download some older release? Then
  <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteREADER/downloads">see all releases</a>.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  As the this app is developed by a single person, it has been tested on some very limited amount of devices. I'd be
  very grateful, if you share your experience with the app, so that I could fill in the list with more supported phones.
</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installing the reader</h1>
<p>
  It's installed like any other Java Mobile game. Transfer the jar file to your device, and then open it up from
  your phone's file manager. If that's not possible, you may need to download the app straight from you phone's
  web browser. You can easily do that, if you visit <a href="http://m.albite.vlexofree.com/reader">the mobile site</a>.
</p>

<h1 id="permissions">Setting up security permissions</h1>
<p>
  On most phones reading and writing files requires security permissions. <i>Albite READER</i> needs both: firstly,
  it obviously needs to read the book files, and, secondly, it needs to write <a href="#alx">per-book settings files</a>
  that contain data about your book progress (including bookmarks). Therefore, if you don't grant permissions to
  <i>Albite READER</i> it will become impossible to use. 
</p>
<p>
  On some phones (e.g. Samsung GT-5230) you need to grant read and write permissions every time you launch the app.
  It's important that you select the option that will grant permissions and would not ask again during the the
  session or you might have to accept hundreds of requests. Such option might be titled <i>Allow, ask once</i> or
  <i>Always allowed</i> or <i>Never ask</i>. If you don't grand read permissions, you <i>wouldn't be able to open
  books</i> and the app would most probably close. If you don't give write permissions, your <i>reading progress would
  not be saved</i>.
</p>

<p>
  On Nokia and Sony-Ericsson phones, you might be able to set permissions once and for all. Go to <i>Tools</i>, then
  <i>App. manager</i>, find <i>Albite READER</i> and set <i>Read user data</i> and <i>Edit user data</i> to
  <i>Always allowed</i>. The following screens are for another app,

  that depending on your phone you <i>might not be able to see some folders</i> or even if you see them, you might
  still <i>not be able to open your books</i> because of security restrictions. So, you might need to <i>experiment</i>
  a little. It's highly probably that you might be asked to

<h2 id="main_screen">Main screen</h2>
<p>
  The main screen is the place you need to get most accustomed to for there you'll be spending most of your time. For
  the same reason, this screen is the most interactive part of the app and needs most explanations.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, you need to know that there are two screen modes: normal and full-screen.

<ul>
  <li>
    <i>Scrolling speed</i> is the speed with which pages are being scrolled.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Smooth scrolling</i> makes scrolling looks more natural. It adjusts the speed so that it's not entirely constant.
  </li>
  <li>
    By default pages are scrolled horizontally. You can also scroll them vertically.
  </li>
  <li>
    The time needed to hold over an area to activate <i>hold mode</i> may be decreased/increased through the
    <i>Long press after</i> slider.

<h1 id="faq">Troubleshooting</h1>
<h2>I can't install the app on my phone</h2>
<p>
  If you can't copy the .jar file to your phone, you'll need to download the app directly from you phone's web browser.
  Visit <a href="http://m.albite.vlexofree.com/reader">the mobile site</a> from your phone and download the app. 
</p>
<p>
  After that you need to open the phone's file browser, navigate to the folder where you put the .jar file and open it.
  If the phone throws an error message, then you might not be able to install the full version, try with
  <a href="#versions">Albite READER Light</a> or <a href="#versions">Albite READER Tiny</a> instead.
</p>

<h2>I can't start the app</h2>
<p>
  Well, there may be many reasons for that. Firstly, you need to <a href="#accept_license">accept the license</a>
  that will show up the first time you run the app. After that you need to
  <a href="#file_browser">navigate to your books folder</a> and select a book to open. Meanwhile you may be asked
  various questions regarding <a href="#permissions">app permissions</a> which you <b><i>must</i></b> accept or the app
  wouldn't work at all. What questions? Well, your phone may ask whether you'd allow <i>Albite READER</i> to read and
  write user data. And your books <i>are</i> user data. Finally, if the app closes unexpectedly or
  behaves in a funny way, you probably haven't got enough resources to run the full version. You should try
  <a href="#versions">Albite READER Light</a> or <a href="#versions">Albite READER Tiny </a> instead. You may also have
  a look at <a href="#system_requirements">the system requirements</a>.
</p>

<h2>Do I need to upgrade the app and how do I do that?</h2>
<p>
  From time to time there may be new versions of <i>Albite READER</i> that fix some existing issues or add new
  functionality. Upgrading the app is easy. Simply uninstall it from your phone and install the new version exactly
  the way you did before. However, you'll may you app settings, i.e. you may need to set the dictionary folder again,
  setup page interaction and color profiles. The good news is that your book settings will be preserved as they are
  saved on the file system along with your books.
</p>

<h2>What are these .alx and .alb files along with my books?</h2>
<p>
  See the section about <a href="#alx">portable book settings</a>.
</p>

<h2>How do I report a bug?</h2>
<p>
  Two ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteREADER/issues">Create an issue at GitHub</a></li>
  <li><%= link_to 'Contact me', contacts_url %> through the feedback button on the left.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is my phone supported?</h2>
<p>
  See <a href="#supported_devices">the list of supported devices</a>. Of course, it's quite likely the app would work
  on devices that are not included in this list as I am very short of testing equipment. 
</p>

<h2>I can't see the book folder or the book file or I can't open the book</h2>
<p>
  Most probably you're having trouble with <a href="#permissions">security permissions</a>. 
</p>

<h2>I am seeing placeholders instead of images.</h2>
<p>
  That may mean several things:

<h2>How do I use dictionaries?</h2>
<p>
  First you need to <a href="#dictionaries">download some</a>, then you have to
  <a href="#dictionary_installation">install them</a> and finally you need to know look up the word. You may do that by
  <i>press, hold and release</i> on a word, by <i>press and release</i> on the magnifying glass button or by
  selecting <i>look up word</i> from the main menu.

<h1 id="features">Features in detail</h1>
<p>
  Here goes a detailed review of all currently implemented features.
</p>

<h2 id="font">Bitmap Font</h2>
<p>
  Bitmap font rendering is achieved through my own implementation. The font used, <i>Droid Serif</i>, has been
  pre-rendered in several different sizes: 12px, 14px, 16px, 18px, 24px and 28px. All have been anti-aliased except for
  the 12px version, which looks much better without it. Supported (or sometimes partially) character ranges are:
</p>

  <li>Doesn't support CSS</li>
  <li>Doesn't support tables</li>
  <li>Doesn't support links and anchors</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alx">Portable book settings: the <i>.alx</i> and <i>.alb</i> files</h2>
<p>
  After opening a book for the first time, <i>Albite READER</i> will create a file with the same name, but
  with an <i>.alx</i> extension. This is a binary file containing your book reading progress. This includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Current chapter and position</li>
  <li>Current hyphenation language</li>
  <li>Last visited position in every chapter</li>
  <li>Current encoding of every chapter</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you make any bookmarks in a book, <i>Albite READER</i> will also create a <i>.alb</i> file.  This is a <i>XML</i>
  file which contains your bookmarked text and positions.
</p>
<p>
  There are several advantages of this technique compared to the usual approach of using the RMS:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can backup your reading progress</li>
  <li>All your book settings are preserved upon application update</li>
  <li>You can continue reading on another phone</li>
  <li>
    Your bookmarks are completely accessible so you can open them in a text processor.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="resources">Used resources</h1>
<p>
  All used sources and binaries are available at <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteResources">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<h2>APIs</h2>
<h3>kXML2</h3>
<p>
  It's a <i>BSD</i>-licensed <i>XML</i> pull parser, especially adequate for <i>Java Mobile</i>.
  It's small and unobtrusive. You can read more at <a href="http://kxml.sourceforge.net/kxml2/">their homepage</a>.
</p>
<h3>AlbiteZIP</h3>
<p>
  It's a <i>Java Mobile</i> port of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a>'s
  <code>java.util.zip</code> package using the
  <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteRandomReadingFile">AlbiteRandomReadingFile</a> API, which implements a
  <code>RandomAccessFile</code> with writing capabilities stripped away. Reading <i>EPUB</i> files relies on
  <i>AlbiteZIP</i> to work with their archives. AlbiteZIP's sources and some sample code are available at
  <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteZIP">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<h3>AlbiteCharacterDecoder</h3>
<p>
  Provides the ability read characters not natively supported by <i>Java</i>'s <code>InputStreamReader</code>.
  The API is based on some code from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/">libiconv</a>. Sources, examples,
  tests and binaries are available at <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteCharacterDecoder">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<h3>AlbiteUnits</h3>
<p>
  A simple java API for converting various physical units. Sources and binaries at
  <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteUnits">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<h3>ZLTextTeXHyphenator</h3>
<p>
  <i>Zlibrary</i>'s hyphenator used in <a href="http://www.fbreader.org/FBReaderJ/">FBReaderJ</a>. Licensed under GPL 2. 
</p>

<h2>Fonts</h2>
<h3>Droid Serif</h3>
<p>
  That's the font used on <i>Android</i> devices. It's quite nice and is built with the idea of rendering well on small
  screens and at small sizes. It supports some good amount of glyphs (around 500) and character ranges. It's
  licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. You can download the Droid fonts in TTF from
  <a href="http://github.com/downloads/dumbledore/AlbiteResources/Droid-TTF.zip">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Building fonts</h3>
<p>
  In order to use the font in <i>Albite READER</i> you need to build it in the right format.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, install <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/">AngelCode Bitmap Font Generator</a>. Now, you
  need to create a bitmap font using the app. We need a bitmap font with xml descriptor, so BFG will produce a png with
  a xml file. Take care to hold all the glyphs on a single page and make the page's area as small as possible.
</p>
<p>
  Then, you need to manually edit the newly created xml file in a suitable form. This time you need to use
  <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteFontBuilder">AlbiteFontBuilder</a>, which will produce the final files.
  See its page for more info.
</p>
<p>
  Note that in order to implement italic text you need to have two fonts, i.e. two versions of the same font.
</p>
<p>
  If the process is still unclear, you'd better explore the files of the font resources used in <i>Albite READER</i>.
</p>
<p>
  You may download the sources and binaries of the bitmap fonts used in <i>Albite READER</i> at
  <a href="http://github.com/downloads/dumbledore/AlbiteResources/Droid-Albite.20101130.225016.zip">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>Hyphenation patterns</h2>
<p>
  The used hyphenation patterns are the ones from <a href="http://www.tug.org/tex-hyphen/">TeX</a>'s site or some
  modified versions from <a href="http://www.fbreader.org/FBReaderJ/">FBReaderJ</a>.
</p>
<h3>Building the patterns</h3>
<p>
  For every language you need to have the patterns in a separate txt file. Each patterns should be on a separate line.
  Then run <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteTeXBuilder">AlbiteTeXBuilder</a> to build the file that will be
  used in <i>Albite READER</i>.
</p>
<p>
  You may download the sources and binaries of the TeX patterns used in <i>Albite READER</i> at
  <a href="http://github.com/downloads/dumbledore/AlbiteResources/tex-patterns.zip">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="dictionaries">Dictionaries</h2>
<p>
  There are some dictionaries ready for download!
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://github.com/downloads/dumbledore/AlbiteResources/wb1913-abrd.zip">Merriam-Webster 1913,
      Abridged version</a> (5.5 MB) based on <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ralph/OPTED/index.html">OPTED</a>.
    Abridged using the <a href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/12dicts-readme.html">3esl</a> word list.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://github.com/downloads/dumbledore/AlbiteResources/wb1913.zip">Merriam-Webster 1913, Full version</a>
    (13.6 MB) based on <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ralph/OPTED/index.html">OPTED</a>. Note that the index alone
    is 1.5MB large, so you need a device with loads of free memory and fast implementation of the File API.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://github.com/downloads/dumbledore/AlbiteResources/glossaries.zip">Some glossaries from Wiktionary</a>.
    Include: Architecture Terminology, British Firefighters Jargon, Chess Terms, Irish Slang and Jargon, Library and
    Information Science, Military Slang, Nautical terms, Scottish Slang, South-African Slang, Truckspeak, US Navy Slang.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that the in order to be used in <i>AlbiteREADER</i> the dictionaries must be unzipped first. See
  <a href="#dictionary_installation">here</a> for
  installation instructions.
</p>
<p>
  All sources and binaries may be found at
  <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteResources/tree/master/Dictionaries/">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<h3>Building your own dictionaries</h3>
<p>
  Dictionaries are prepared as <i>XML</i> files that are then converted into binary files using
  <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteDictionaryBuilder">AlbiteDictionaryBuilder</a>. Dictionary entries can
  also be filtered against a wordlist so that one can automatically create abridged editions. See the page of the tool
  for some more exhausting information.
</p>
<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>
  Most graphics are made by me, except for the book icon that is made by
  <a href="http://simiographics.deviantart.com/">SimioGraphics</a> and the tiny icons of the folders, files, the
  check icon and the broken image icon that I downloaded from the internet.
</p>
<h3>Building the graphics</h3>
<p>
  You need to use <a href="http://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteImageConverter">AlbiteImageBuilder</a> to build the
  images into the binary format.
</p>

<h1 id="limitations">Current limitations</h1>
<p>
  There are too many limited factors: your phone is limited, Java Mobile is limited and my personal time is limited. So,
  it points to the conclusion that <i>Albite READER</i> is limited, too. I'd like you to know of the current
  limitations, so that you can decide for yourself if they may stand in your way.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No support for links and anchors (i.e. objects findable by their id)</li>
  <li>
    No support for <i>toc.ncx</i>. Chapters are made according to the files from the <i>spine</i> element in the
    <i>opf</i> file and are titled using a successive number.
  </li>
  <li>
    No support for accelerometers. I know it's cool, but there are some technical limitations to consider, including
    battery life when reading for a long time. No to mention that I often tilt the phone to a variety of angles if
    I am reading in my bed.
  </li>
  <li>No book library. Books are opened through a file browser.</li>
  <li>Images are shown in separate pages.
  </li>
  <li>
    Font is available in four sizes only. That's because bitmap fonts are being used. Using SVG/TTF fonts is not only
    slow (one can cache the glyphs after all), but ugly. Or one may need super-sampling which would make it <i>terribly</i>
    slow. Java Mobile on the other hand, has limited supported for fonts. It supports a maximum of three font sizes,
    and often limited amount of glyphs. Not to mention the fact that font rendering in Java Mobile is dreadfully
    on some devices (like my Samsung GT-5230).
  </li>
  <li>No support for subscript and superscript. That's because of the previous limitation.</li>
  <li>No support for tables.</li>
  <li>No support for CSS.</li>
  <li>
    Books with too many chapters might make the current TOC unusable. For instance, the complete <i>War and Peace</i>
    has more than 300 chapters, so the list of chapters becomes incredibly long and painful to browse. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Languages with right-to-left text direction or hieroglyphic ones are not supported, including Chinese, Japanese,
    Hebrew, Arabic, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    No language localization. In other words, the app is available only in English.  
  </li>
  <li>
    No bold fonts. Instead of using bold fonts, the text is rendered in another color. Using bitmap fonts would
    significantly (i.e. at least twice) increase the size of both JAR and needed heap memory.   
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a theoretical possibility of corruption of the <i>.alx</i> files. More precisely, it can happen if the
    battery dies exactly when saving the data to the phone or if the app is closed using the red key and it is
    unable to close fast enough. Thankfully enough, this possibility must be <i>very</i> slight in most
    situations.
  </li>
</ul>
