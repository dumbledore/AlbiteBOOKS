# Read free e-books on your mobile?

It seems you've come to the right place!

Here you'll find *free* e-books, that have been *specially optimized for your phone*. All books are *split to chapters*, and *compiled as EPUB files*, so that they'll *load fast* and *run smoothly* on your device. Many children's books, *have images*, too, and they have been re-sized so that they'd take very little space. 

Search for and download books from you phone's browser? Just put an 'm' as the first sub-domain, like so: <http://m.albite.vlexofree.com/>. 

Next step is *reading the books* or, in other words, getting a book reader for your phone. If you have a *Java-Mobile powered* device you may have a look at [Albite READER][1], see the video a few pixels down this text? If you like it, well, go ahead and [download][1] it! It's free. Oh, and by the way, it does support dictionary look-up, yes. But then, why don't make a dictionary yourself? You see, [Albite READER][1] is also open-source. 

# What's special about the *Albite* project?

Well, *Android* users got [FBReaderJ][2] and [Aldiko][3], and *iPhone* users got [Stanza][4] and many more. What if you wanted some similar experience on your *Java Mobile* phone, too? 

There you are: *Albite*. Open *Albite BOOKS* on your phone's web-browser ([Opera Mini][5] is a good choice for that purpose), search for books & authors, read the summaries about them, then pick a book, download it, and start reading on *Albite READER*! 

So, the idea is to make reading on *Java Mobile* devices a lot more comfortable. 

# How is *Albite Books* different from *PG* or *MB*?

*Albite BOOKS* does not compete with [Project Gutenberg][6] or [Manybooks][7] as it's different in a few ways: 

*   While PG and MB provide books in many different file formats and for many different devices, *Albite BOOKS* aims at delivering content optimized for mobile phones. 
*   Unlike PG, *Albite BOOKS* is supported by one person only. 
*   Special care has been given to the [mobile version][8] so that browsing on mobile phones feels comfortable, looks nice and retains most of the features of the original version. 

# How does *Albite Reader* compare to *FBReaderJ* or *Stanza*?

The same way *Java Mobile* compares to *Android* and *iOS*: it's far more limited, quite a bit uglier, but still capable of doing nice stuff, if one makes it to. 

# Why are the books free?

All books come from [Project Gutenberg][9], so they are free for the same reason the books on PG are free: 

> Our ebooks are free in the United States because their copyright has expired.
> They may not be free of copyright in other countries. Readers outside of the
> United States must check the copyright laws of their countries before
> downloading or redistributing our ebooks.

# Who made Albite?

My name is [Svetlin Ankov][10], I am 23, and I am a student at the [University of Sofia][11]. For most of my time I do programming stuff, but I like math, too, especially if it’s got a more applied nature. 

I am best at *Java*, but I also have experience with *C++*, *Python*, *Ruby*, *Visual Basic*, *Pascal*, *ActionScript* and *PHP*. 

I have some idea of functional programming, too, as I’ve done some good amount of projects in [Matlab][12] and [Mathematica][13]. I prefer simpler code, but I am not too scared to go deep, if it’s the only option. 

As far as math is concerned, I don’t like it raw, but prefer it in connection with other sciences, e.g. numerical analysis, discreet math, statistics, biomathematics, etc. I’ve had the chance to [teach biomath][14] as an assistant, i.e. I was responsible for the demonstrative part of the subject. In relation with that, I can say, I wrote some good quantity of *Mathematica* code and some lesser amount of mathematical stuff.
